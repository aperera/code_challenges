    "To solve the puzzle, we must first create a list with each item (calories), including separators as empty elements. The code uses `with open` to read the input file, ensuring the file is automatically closed after the read-only operation. It processes the file line by line, removing leading and trailing white spaces and populating a list assigned to the variable `lines`. Finally, the list is displayed on the screen using `print (lines)`."

In this case, the sum of the integers in the set is appended to the calories_sum_list using the append() method. The calories_sum variable is reset to 0 in preparation for the next set of integers.\n",
